    <h2>Description</h2>
   <p> Another simple but heavenly recipe. 
    Paired with the "meaty" tagliatelle,

</p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>1 - Whole Carrot</li>
    <li>4 Tbsp - Olive oil</li>
    <li>1/2 - Large onion (Finely diced)</li>
    <li>800g - Lean minced beef</li>

    <li>1 - Beef stock cube</li>
    <li>300ml - Boiling water</li>
    <li>4 Tbsp - Tomato puree</li>
</ul>
<h2>Method</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Make up the beef stock using the boiling
         water and the beef stock cube. Put this in a small saucepan 
        on a low heat to keep it hot.</li>
    <li>Heat the oil in a saucepan, fry the onion & carrot for until the onion has softened.</li>
    <li>Brown the mince.</li>
    <li>Once the mince is browned, pour in the red wine,
        stir well then simmer for 2 minutes.
    </li>
    <li>Add the milk and follow the same steps
         as you did with the red wine.</li>
         <li>Now you can add the beef stock you made earlier, as well as 
            the passata & tomato puree.</li>
            <li>Stir well, then bring to the boil.</li>
            <li>Once boiling place the lid on the pan 
                & turn the heat down to low medium. 
                Leave this to simmer for 1 to 1.5 hours
                stirring occasionally.
            </li>
            <li>Boil the tagliatelle as per the instruction on the package.</li>
            <li>Serve & enjoy.</li>

<h3>Bonus tip</h3>
<p>I usually peel then grate the carrot on the cheese grater
    to get it finer then I could chop it.
