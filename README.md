<p>This is my first major project within the TOP curriculum. Here I had the chance to put into practice everything they have taught about using HTML, Git & Github. </p>

<p>Creating boilerplate, different sized headings, ordered & unordered lists, paragraphs. Git cloning, staging and committing etc.</p>
